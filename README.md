# Directional-Assistive-device-for-deaf
A wearable that gives a directional sense of sound to a hearing-impaired user, using tactile feedback

The device does 3 tasks in general
1.  It constantly detects the type of sounds in the surrounding, so whenever alert sounds, such as car horns, calling of the name of the person, etc. is detected it signals the user.
2.  It detects the direction of arrival of sound i.e. where the source of sound is located.
3.  Whenever an alert sound is detected, the device gives the user tactile feedback (using the onboard vibrotactile motors) so he knows the direction from where this sound is coming, allowing him to better communicate with the surroundings.
